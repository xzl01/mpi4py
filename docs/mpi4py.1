.SS Abstract
.sp
This document describes the \fIMPI for Python\fP package. \fIMPI for
Python\fP provides Python bindings for the \fIMessage Passing
Interface\fP (MPI) standard, allowing Python applications to exploit
multiple processors on workstations, clusters and supercomputers.
.sp
This package builds on the MPI specification and provides an object
oriented interface resembling the MPI\-2 C++ bindings. It supports
point\-to\-point (sends, receives) and collective (broadcasts,
scatters, gathers) communication of any \fIpicklable\fP Python object,
as well as efficient communication of Python objects exposing the
Python buffer interface (e.g. NumPy arrays and builtin
bytes/array/memoryview objects).
.SH INTRODUCTION
.sp
Over the last years, high performance computing has become an
affordable resource to many more researchers in the scientific
community than ever before. The conjunction of quality open source
software and commodity hardware strongly influenced the now widespread
popularity of \fI\%Beowulf\fP class clusters and cluster of workstations.
.sp
Among many parallel computational models, message\-passing has proven
to be an effective one.  This paradigm is specially suited for (but
not limited to) distributed memory architectures and is used in
today’s most demanding scientific and engineering application related
to modeling, simulation, design, and signal processing.  However,
portable message\-passing parallel programming used to be a nightmare
in the past because of the many incompatible options developers were
faced to.  Fortunately, this situation definitely changed after the
MPI Forum released its standard specification.
.sp
High performance computing is traditionally associated with software
development using compiled languages. However, in typical applications
programs, only a small part of the code is time\-critical enough to
require the efficiency of compiled languages. The rest of the code is
generally related to memory management, error handling, input/output,
and user interaction, and those are usually the most error prone and
time\-consuming lines of code to write and debug in the whole
development process.  Interpreted high\-level languages can be really
advantageous for this kind of tasks.
.sp
For implementing general\-purpose numerical computations, MATLAB [1]
is the dominant interpreted programming language. In the open source
side, Octave and Scilab are well known, freely distributed software
packages providing compatibility with the MATLAB language. In this
work, we present MPI for Python, a new package enabling applications
to exploit multiple processors using standard MPI “look and feel” in
Python scripts.

.SS What is MPI?
.sp
\fI\%MPI\fP, [mpi\-using] [mpi\-ref] the \fIMessage Passing Interface\fP, is a
standardized and portable message\-passing system designed to function
on a wide variety of parallel computers. The standard defines the
syntax and semantics of library routines and allows users to write
portable programs in the main scientific programming languages
(Fortran, C, or C++).
.sp
Since its release, the MPI specification [mpi\-std1] [mpi\-std2] has
become the leading standard for message\-passing libraries for parallel
computers.  Implementations are available from vendors of
high\-performance computers and from well known open source projects
like \fI\%MPICH\fP [mpi\-mpich] and \fI\%Open MPI\fP [mpi\-openmpi]\&.
.SS What is Python?
.sp
\fI\%Python\fP is a modern, easy to learn, powerful programming language. It
has efficient high\-level data structures and a simple but effective
approach to object\-oriented programming with dynamic typing and
dynamic binding. It supports modules and packages, which encourages
program modularity and code reuse. Python’s elegant syntax, together
with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting
and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
.sp
The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are
available in source or binary form without charge for all major
platforms, and can be freely distributed. It is easily extended with
new functions and data types implemented in C or C++. Python is also
suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.
.sp
Python is an ideal candidate for writing the higher\-level parts of
large\-scale scientific applications [Hinsen97] and driving
simulations in parallel architectures [Beazley97] like clusters of
PC’s or SMP’s. Python codes are quickly developed, easily maintained,
and can achieve a high degree of integration with other libraries
written in compiled languages.

.SH OVERVIEW
.sp
MPI for Python provides an object oriented approach to message passing
which grounds on the standard MPI\-2 C++ bindings. The interface was
designed with focus in translating MPI syntax and semantics of
standard MPI\-2 bindings for C++ to Python. Any user of the standard
C/C++ MPI bindings should be able to use this module without need of
learning a new interface.
.SS Communicating Python Objects and Array Data
.sp
The Python standard library supports different mechanisms for data
persistence. Many of them rely on disk storage, but \fIpickling\fP and
\fImarshaling\fP can also work with memory buffers.
.sp
The \fI\%pickle\fP modules provide user\-extensible facilities to
serialize general Python objects using ASCII or binary formats. The
\fI\%marshal\fP module provides facilities to serialize built\-in Python
objects using a binary format specific to Python, but independent of
machine architecture issues.
.sp
\fIMPI for Python\fP can communicate any built\-in or user\-defined Python
object taking advantage of the features provided by the \fI\%pickle\fP
module. These facilities will be routinely used to build binary
representations of objects to communicate (at sending processes), and
restoring them back (at receiving processes).
.sp
Although simple and general, the serialization approach (i.e.,
\fIpickling\fP and \fIunpickling\fP) previously discussed imposes important
overheads in memory as well as processor usage, especially in the
scenario of objects with large memory footprints being
communicated. Pickling general Python objects, ranging from primitive
or container built\-in types to user\-defined classes, necessarily
requires computer resources.  Processing is also needed for
dispatching the appropriate serialization method (that depends on the
type of the object) and doing the actual packing. Additional memory is
always needed, and if its total amount is not known \fIa priori\fP, many
reallocations can occur.  Indeed, in the case of large numeric arrays,
this is certainly unacceptable and precludes communication of objects
occupying half or more of the available memory resources.
.sp
\fIMPI for Python\fP supports direct communication of any object exporting
the single\-segment buffer interface. This interface is a standard
Python mechanism provided by some types (e.g., strings and numeric
arrays), allowing access in the C side to a contiguous memory buffer
(i.e., address and length) containing the relevant data. This feature,
in conjunction with the capability of constructing user\-defined MPI
datatypes describing complicated memory layouts, enables the
implementation of many algorithms involving multidimensional numeric
arrays (e.g., image processing, fast Fourier transforms, finite
difference schemes on structured Cartesian grids) directly in Python,
with negligible overhead, and almost as fast as compiled Fortran, C,
or C++ codes.
.SS Communicators
.sp
In \fIMPI for Python\fP, \fBComm\fP is the base class of communicators. The
\fBIntracomm\fP and \fBIntercomm\fP classes are sublcasses of the \fBComm\fP
class.  The \fBComm.Is_inter\fP method (and \fBComm.Is_intra\fP, provided for
convenience but not part of the MPI specification) is defined for
communicator objects and can be used to determine the particular
communicator class.
.sp
The two predefined intracommunicator instances are available:
\fBCOMM_SELF\fP and \fBCOMM_WORLD\fP\&. From them, new communicators can be
created as needed.
.sp
The number of processes in a communicator and the calling process rank
can be respectively obtained with methods \fBComm.Get_size\fP and
\fBComm.Get_rank\fP\&. The associated process group can be retrieved from a
communicator by calling the \fBComm.Get_group\fP method, which returns an
instance of the \fBGroup\fP class. Set operations with \fBGroup\fP objects
like like \fBGroup.Union\fP, \fBGroup.Intersection\fP and \fBGroup.Difference\fP
are fully supported, as well as the creation of new communicators from
these groups using \fBComm.Create\fP and \fBComm.Create_group\fP\&.
.sp
New communicator instances can be obtained with the \fBComm.Clone\fP,
\fBComm.Dup\fP and \fBComm.Split\fP methods, as well methods
\fBIntracomm.Create_intercomm\fP and \fBIntercomm.Merge\fP\&.
.sp
Virtual topologies (\fBCartcomm\fP, \fBGraphcomm\fP and \fBDistgraphcomm\fP
classes, which are specializations of the \fBIntracomm\fP class) are fully
supported. New instances can be obtained from intracommunicator
instances with factory methods \fBIntracomm.Create_cart\fP and
\fBIntracomm.Create_graph\fP\&.
.SS Point\-to\-Point Communications
.sp
Point to point communication is a fundamental capability of message
passing systems. This mechanism enables the transmission of data
between a pair of processes, one side sending, the other receiving.
.sp
MPI provides a set of \fIsend\fP and \fIreceive\fP functions allowing the
communication of \fItyped\fP data with an associated \fItag\fP\&.  The type
information enables the conversion of data representation from one
architecture to another in the case of heterogeneous computing
environments; additionally, it allows the representation of
non\-contiguous data layouts and user\-defined datatypes, thus avoiding
the overhead of (otherwise unavoidable) packing/unpacking
operations. The tag information allows selectivity of messages at the
receiving end.
.SS Blocking Communications
.sp
MPI provides basic send and receive functions that are \fIblocking\fP\&.
These functions block the caller until the data buffers involved in
the communication can be safely reused by the application program.
.sp
In \fIMPI for Python\fP, the \fBComm.Send\fP, \fBComm.Recv\fP and \fBComm.Sendrecv\fP
methods of communicator objects provide support for blocking
point\-to\-point communications within \fBIntracomm\fP and \fBIntercomm\fP
instances. These methods can communicate memory buffers. The variants
\fBComm.send\fP, \fBComm.recv\fP and \fBComm.sendrecv\fP can communicate general
Python objects.
.SS Nonblocking Communications
.sp
On many systems, performance can be significantly increased by
overlapping communication and computation. This is particularly true
on systems where communication can be executed autonomously by an
intelligent, dedicated communication controller.
.sp
MPI provides \fInonblocking\fP send and receive functions. They allow the
possible overlap of communication and computation.  Non\-blocking
communication always come in two parts: posting functions, which begin
the requested operation; and test\-for\-completion functions, which
allow to discover whether the requested operation has completed.
.sp
In \fIMPI for Python\fP, the \fBComm.Isend\fP and \fBComm.Irecv\fP methods
initiate send and receive operations, respectively. These methods
return a \fBRequest\fP instance, uniquely identifying the started
operation.  Its completion can be managed using the \fBRequest.Test\fP,
\fBRequest.Wait\fP and \fBRequest.Cancel\fP methods. The management of
\fBRequest\fP objects and associated memory buffers involved in
communication requires a careful, rather low\-level coordination. Users
must ensure that objects exposing their memory buffers are not
accessed at the Python level while they are involved in nonblocking
message\-passing operations.
.SS Persistent Communications
.sp
Often a communication with the same argument list is repeatedly
executed within an inner loop. In such cases, communication can be
further optimized by using persistent communication, a particular case
of nonblocking communication allowing the reduction of the overhead
between processes and communication controllers. Furthermore , this
kind of optimization can also alleviate the extra call overheads
associated to interpreted, dynamic languages like Python.
.sp
In \fIMPI for Python\fP, the \fBComm.Send_init\fP and \fBComm.Recv_init\fP methods
create persistent requests for a send and receive operation,
respectively.  These methods return an instance of the \fBPrequest\fP
class, a subclass of the \fBRequest\fP class. The actual communication can
be effectively started using the \fBPrequest.Start\fP method, and its
completion can be managed as previously described.
.SS Collective Communications
.sp
Collective communications allow the transmittal of data between
multiple processes of a group simultaneously. The syntax and semantics
of collective functions is consistent with point\-to\-point
communication. Collective functions communicate \fItyped\fP data, but
messages are not paired with an associated \fItag\fP; selectivity of
messages is implied in the calling order. Additionally, collective
functions come in blocking versions only.
.sp
The more commonly used collective communication operations are the
following.
.INDENT 0.0

Barrier synchronization across all group members.
.IP \(bu 2
Global communication functions
.INDENT 2.0

.IP \(bu 2
Global reduction operations such as sum, maximum, minimum, etc.
.UNINDENT
.sp
In \fIMPI for Python\fP, the \fBComm.Bcast\fP, \fBComm.Scatter\fP, \fBComm.Gather\fP,
\fBComm.Allgather\fP, \fBComm.Alltoall\fP methods provide support for
collective communications of memory buffers. The lower\-case variants
\fBComm.bcast\fP, \fBComm.scatter\fP, \fBComm.gather\fP, \fBComm.allgather\fP and
\fBComm.alltoall\fP can communicate general Python objects.  The vector
variants (which can communicate different amounts of data to each
process) \fBComm.Scatterv\fP, \fBComm.Gatherv\fP, \fBComm.Allgatherv\fP,
\fBComm.Alltoallv\fP and \fBComm.Alltoallw\fP are also supported, they can
only communicate objects exposing memory buffers.
.sp
Global reducion operations on memory buffers are accessible through
the \fBComm.Reduce\fP, \fBComm.Reduce_scatter\fP, \fBComm.Allreduce\fP,
\fBIntracomm.Scan\fP and \fBIntracomm.Exscan\fP methods. The lower\-case
variants \fBComm.reduce\fP, \fBComm.allreduce\fP, \fBIntracomm.scan\fP and
\fBIntracomm.exscan\fP can communicate general Python objects; however,
the actual required reduction computations are performed sequentially
at some process. All the predefined (i.e., \fBSUM\fP, \fBPROD\fP, \fBMAX\fP, etc.)
reduction operations can be applied.
.SS Support for GPU\-aware MPI
.sp
Several MPI implementations, including Open MPI and MVAPICH, support
passing GPU pointers to MPI calls to avoid explict data movement
between the host and the device. On the Python side, GPU arrays have
been implemented by many libraries that need GPU computation, such as
CuPy, Numba, PyTorch, and PyArrow. In order to increase library
interoperability, two kinds of zero\-copy data exchange protocols are
defined and agreed upon: \fI\%DLPack\fP and \fI\%CUDA Array Interface\fP\&. For
example, a CuPy array can be passed to a Numba CUDA\-jit kernel.
.sp
\fIMPI for Python\fP provides an experimental support for GPU\-aware MPI.
This feature requires:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
mpi4py is built against a GPU\-aware MPI library.
.IP 2. 3
The Python GPU arrays are compliant with either of the protocols.
.UNINDENT
.sp

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Whether or not a MPI call can work for GPU arrays depends on the
underlying MPI implementation, not on mpi4py.
.IP \(bu 2
This support is currently experimental and subject to change in the
future.
.UNINDENT
.SS Dynamic Process Management
.sp
In the context of the MPI\-1 specification, a parallel application is
static; that is, no processes can be added to or deleted from a
running application after it has been started. Fortunately, this
limitation was addressed in MPI\-2. The new specification added a
process management model providing a basic interface between an
application and external resources and process managers.
.sp
This MPI\-2 extension can be really useful, especially for sequential
applications built on top of parallel modules, or parallel
applications with a client/server model. The MPI\-2 process model
provides a mechanism to create new processes and establish
communication between them and the existing MPI application. It also
provides mechanisms to establish communication between two existing
MPI applications, even when one did not \fIstart\fP the other.
.sp
In \fIMPI for Python\fP, new independent process groups can be created by
calling the \fBIntracomm.Spawn\fP method within an intracommunicator.
This call returns a new intercommunicator (i.e., an \fBIntercomm\fP
instance) at the parent process group. The child process group can
retrieve the matching intercommunicator by calling the
\fBComm.Get_parent\fP class method. At each side, the new
intercommunicator can be used to perform point to point and collective
communications between the parent and child groups of processes.
.sp
Alternatively, disjoint groups of processes can establish
communication using a client/server approach. Any server application
must first call the \fBOpen_port\fP function to open a \fIport\fP and the
\fBPublish_name\fP function to publish a provided \fIservice\fP, and next call
the \fBIntracomm.Accept\fP method.  Any client applications can first find
a published \fIservice\fP by calling the \fBLookup_name\fP function, which
returns the \fIport\fP where a server can be contacted; and next call the
\fBIntracomm.Connect\fP method. Both \fBIntracomm.Accept\fP and
\fBIntracomm.Connect\fP methods return an \fBIntercomm\fP instance. When
connection between client/server processes is no longer needed, all of
them must cooperatively call the \fBComm.Disconnect\fP
method. Additionally, server applications should release resources by
calling the \fBUnpublish_name\fP and \fBClose_port\fP functions.
.SS One\-Sided Communications
.sp
One\-sided communications (also called \fIRemote Memory Access\fP, \fIRMA\fP)
supplements the traditional two\-sided, send/receive based MPI
communication model with a one\-sided, put/get based
interface. One\-sided communication that can take advantage of the
capabilities of highly specialized network hardware. Additionally,
this extension lowers latency and software overhead in applications
written using a shared\-memory\-like paradigm.
.sp
The MPI specification revolves around the use of objects called
\fIwindows\fP; they intuitively specify regions of a process’s memory that
have been made available for remote read and write operations.  The
published memory blocks can be accessed through three functions for
put (remote send), get (remote write), and accumulate (remote update
or reduction) data items. A much larger number of functions support
different synchronization styles; the semantics of these
synchronization operations are fairly complex.
.sp
In \fIMPI for Python\fP, one\-sided operations are available by using
instances of the \fBWin\fP class. New window objects are created by
calling the \fBWin.Create\fP method at all processes within a communicator
and specifying a memory buffer . When a window instance is no longer
needed, the \fBWin.Free\fP method should be called.
.sp
The three one\-sided MPI operations for remote write, read and
reduction are available through calling the methods \fBWin.Put\fP,
\fBWin.Get\fP, and \fBWin.Accumulate\fP respectively within a \fBWin\fP instance.
These methods need an integer rank identifying the target process and
an integer offset relative the base address of the remote memory block
being accessed.
.sp
The one\-sided operations read, write, and reduction are implicitly
nonblocking, and must be synchronized by using two primary modes.
Active target synchronization requires the origin process to call the
\fBWin.Start\fP and \fBWin.Complete\fP methods at the origin process, and
target process cooperates by calling the \fBWin.Post\fP and \fBWin.Wait\fP
methods. There is also a collective variant provided by the
\fBWin.Fence\fP method. Passive target synchronization is more lenient,
only the origin process calls the \fBWin.Lock\fP and \fBWin.Unlock\fP
methods. Locks are used to protect remote accesses to the locked
remote window and to protect local load/store accesses to a locked
local window.
.SS Parallel Input/Output
.sp
The POSIX standard provides a model of a widely portable file
system. However, the optimization needed for parallel input/output
cannot be achieved with this generic interface. In order to ensure
efficiency and scalability, the underlying parallel input/output
system must provide a high\-level interface supporting partitioning of
file data among processes and a collective interface supporting
complete transfers of global data structures between process memories
and files. Additionally, further efficiencies can be gained via
support for asynchronous input/output, strided accesses to data, and
control over physical file layout on storage devices. This scenario
motivated the inclusion in the MPI\-2 standard of a custom interface in
order to support more elaborated parallel input/output operations.
.sp
The MPI specification for parallel input/output revolves around the
use objects called \fIfiles\fP\&. As defined by MPI, files are not just
contiguous byte streams. Instead, they are regarded as ordered
collections of \fItyped\fP data items. MPI supports sequential or random
access to any integral set of these items. Furthermore, files are
opened collectively by a group of processes.
.sp
The common patterns for accessing a shared file (broadcast, scatter,
gather, reduction) is expressed by using user\-defined datatypes.
Compared to the communication patterns of point\-to\-point and
collective communications, this approach has the advantage of added
flexibility and expressiveness. Data access operations (read and
write) are defined for different kinds of positioning (using explicit
offsets, individual file pointers, and shared file pointers),
coordination (non\-collective and collective), and synchronism
(blocking, nonblocking, and split collective with begin/end phases).
.sp
In \fIMPI for Python\fP, all MPI input/output operations are performed
through instances of the \fBFile\fP class. File handles are obtained by
calling the \fBFile.Open\fP method at all processes within a communicator
and providing a file name and the intended access mode.  After use,
they must be closed by calling the \fBFile.Close\fP method.  Files even
can be deleted by calling method \fBFile.Delete\fP\&.
.sp
After creation, files are typically associated with a per\-process
\fIview\fP\&. The view defines the current set of data visible and
accessible from an open file as an ordered set of elementary
datatypes. This data layout can be set and queried with the
\fBFile.Set_view\fP and \fBFile.Get_view\fP methods respectively.
.sp
Actual input/output operations are achieved by many methods combining
read and write calls with different behavior regarding positioning,
coordination, and synchronism. Summing up, \fIMPI for Python\fP provides
the thirty (30) methods defined in MPI\-2 for reading from or writing
to files using explicit offsets or file pointers (individual or
shared), in blocking or nonblocking and collective or noncollective
versions.
.SS Environmental Management
.SS Initialization and Exit

Module functions \fBInit\fP or \fBInit_thread\fP and \fBFinalize\fP provide MPI

\fBMPI_Init()\fP or \fBMPI_Init_thread()\fP is actually called
when you import the \fBMPI\fP module from the
\fBmpi4py\fP package, but only if MPI is not already
initialized. In such case, calling \fBInit\fP or \fBInit_thread\fP from
Python is expected to generate an MPI error, and in turn an
exception will be raised.

\fBMPI_Finalize()\fP is registered (by using Python C/API
function \fI\%Py_AtExit()\fP) for being automatically called when
Python processes exit, but only if \fBmpi4py\fP actually
initialized MPI. Therefore, there is no need to call \fBFinalize\fP
from Python to ensure MPI finalization.

MPI timer functionalities are available through the \fBWtime\fP and

.SS Error Handling
.sp
In order facilitate handle sharing with other Python modules
interfacing MPI\-based parallel libraries, the predefined MPI error
handlers \fBERRORS_RETURN\fP and \fBERRORS_ARE_FATAL\fP can be assigned to and
retrieved from communicators using methods \fBComm.Set_errhandler\fP and
\fBComm.Get_errhandler\fP, and similarly for windows and files.
.sp
When the predefined error handler \fBERRORS_RETURN\fP is set, errors
returned from MPI calls within Python code will raise an instance of
the exception class \fBException\fP, which is a subclass of the standard
Python exception \fI\%RuntimeError\fP\&.

After import, mpi4py overrides the default MPI rules governing
inheritance of error handlers. The \fBERRORS_RETURN\fP error handler is
set in the predefined \fBCOMM_SELF\fP and \fBCOMM_WORLD\fP communicators,
as well as any new \fBComm\fP, \fBWin\fP, or \fBFile\fP instance created
through mpi4py. If you ever pass such handles to C/C++/Fortran
library code, it is recommended to set the \fBERRORS_ARE_FATAL\fP error
handler on them to ensure MPI errors do not pass silently.

\fIMPI for Python\fP supports convenient, \fIpickle\fP\-based communication of
generic Python object as well as fast, near C\-speed, direct array data
communication of buffer\-provider objects (e.g., NumPy arrays).
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Communication of generic Python objects
.sp
You have to use methods with \fBall\-lowercase\fP names, like
\fBComm.send\fP, \fBComm.recv\fP, \fBComm.bcast\fP, \fBComm.scatter\fP,
\fBComm.gather\fP . An object to be sent is passed as a parameter to the
communication call, and the received object is simply the return
value.
.sp
The \fBComm.isend\fP and \fBComm.irecv\fP methods return \fBRequest\fP
instances; completion of these methods can be managed using the
\fBRequest.test\fP and \fBRequest.wait\fP methods.
.sp
The \fBComm.recv\fP and \fBComm.irecv\fP methods may be passed a buffer
object that can be repeatedly used to receive messages avoiding
internal memory allocation. This buffer must be sufficiently large
to accommodate the transmitted messages; hence, any buffer passed to
\fBComm.recv\fP or \fBComm.irecv\fP must be at least as long as the
\fIpickled\fP data transmitted to the receiver.
.sp
Collective calls like \fBComm.scatter\fP, \fBComm.gather\fP,
\fBComm.allgather\fP, \fBComm.alltoall\fP expect a single value or a
sequence of \fBComm.size\fP elements at the root or all process. They
return a single value, a list of \fBComm.size\fP elements, or \fI\%None\fP\&.

\fIMPI for Python\fP uses the \fBhighest\fP \fI\%protocol version\fP available in the Python runtime (see the
\fI\%HIGHEST_PROTOCOL\fP constant in the \fI\%pickle\fP
module).  The default protocol can be changed at import time by
setting the \fBMPI4PY_PICKLE_PROTOCOL\fP environment
variable, or at runtime by assigning a different value to the
\fBPROTOCOL\fP attribute of the
\fBpickle\fP object within the \fBMPI\fP
module.

Communication of buffer\-like objects
.sp
You have to use method names starting with an \fBupper\-case\fP letter,
like \fBComm.Send\fP, \fBComm.Recv\fP, \fBComm.Bcast\fP, \fBComm.Scatter\fP,
\fBComm.Gather\fP\&.
.sp
In general, buffer arguments to these calls must be explicitly
specified by using a 2/3\-list/tuple like \fB[data, MPI.DOUBLE]\fP, or
\fB[data, count, MPI.DOUBLE]\fP (the former one uses the byte\-size of
\fBdata\fP and the extent of the MPI datatype to define \fBcount\fP).
.sp
For vector collectives communication operations like
\fBComm.Scatterv\fP and \fBComm.Gatherv\fP, buffer arguments are
specified as \fB[data, count, displ, datatype]\fP, where \fBcount\fP and
\fBdispl\fP are sequences of integral values.
.sp
Automatic MPI datatype discovery for NumPy/GPU arrays and PEP\-3118
buffers is supported, but limited to basic C types (all C/C99\-native
signed/unsigned integral types and single/double precision
real/complex floating types) and availability of matching datatypes
in the underlying MPI implementation. In this case, the
buffer\-provider object can be passed directly as a buffer argument,
the count and MPI datatype will be inferred.
.sp
If mpi4py is built against a GPU\-aware MPI implementation, GPU
arrays can be passed to upper\-case methods as long as they have
either the \fB__dlpack__\fP and \fB__dlpack_device__\fP methods or the
\fB__cuda_array_interface__\fP attribute that are compliant with the
respective standard specifications. Moreover, only C\-contiguous or
Fortran\-contiguous GPU arrays are supported. It is important to note
that GPU buffers must be fully ready before any MPI routines operate
on them to avoid race conditions. This can be ensured by using the
synchronization API of your array library. mpi4py does not have
access to any GPU\-specific functionality and thus cannot perform
this operation automatically for users.

The \fIMessage Passing Interface\fP (MPI) is a standardized and portable
message\-passing system designed to function on a wide variety of
parallel computers. The MPI standard defines the syntax and semantics
of library routines and allows users to write portable programs in the
main scientific programming languages (Fortran, C, or C++). Since its
release, the MPI specification has become the leading standard for
message\-passing libraries for parallel computers.
.sp
\fIMPI for Python\fP provides MPI bindings for the Python programming
language, allowing any Python program to exploit multiple processors.
This package build on the MPI specification and provides an object

New in version 3.0.0.

.sp
This package provides a high\-level interface for asynchronously executing
callables on a pool of worker processes using MPI for inter\-process
communication.
.SS concurrent.futures
.sp
The \fI\%mpi4py.futures\fP package is based on \fI\%concurrent.futures\fP from
the Python standard library. More precisely, \fI\%mpi4py.futures\fP provides the
\fI\%MPIPoolExecutor\fP class as a concrete implementation of the abstract
class \fI\%Executor\fP\&.  The
\fI\%submit()\fP interface schedules a callable to
be executed asynchronously and returns a \fI\%Future\fP
object representing the execution of the callable.
\fI\%Future\fP instances can be queried for the call
result or exception. Sets of \fI\%Future\fP instances can
be passed to the \fI\%wait()\fP and
\fI\%as_completed()\fP functions.

The \fI\%concurrent.futures\fP package was introduced in Python 3.2. A
\fI\%backport\fP targeting Python 2.7 is available on \fI\%PyPI\fP\&. The \fI\%mpi4py.futures\fP package uses
\fI\%concurrent.futures\fP if available, either from the Python 3 standard
library or the Python 2.7 backport if installed. Otherwise,
\fI\%mpi4py.futures\fP uses a bundled copy of core functionality backported
from Python 3.5 to work with Python 2.7.

.sp
The \fI\%MPIPoolExecutor\fP class uses a pool of MPI processes to execute
calls asynchronously. By performing computations in separate processes, it
allows to side\-step the \fI\%global interpreter lock\fP but also means that
only picklable objects can be executed and returned. The \fI\%__main__\fP module
must be importable by worker processes, thus \fI\%MPIPoolExecutor\fP instances
may not work in the interactive interpreter.
.sp
\fI\%MPIPoolExecutor\fP takes advantage of the dynamic process management
features introduced in the MPI\-2 standard. In particular, the
\fBMPI.Intracomm.Spawn\fP method of \fBMPI.COMM_SELF\fP is used in the master (or
parent) process to spawn new worker (or child) processes running a Python
interpreter. The master process uses a separate thread (one for each
\fI\%MPIPoolExecutor\fP instance) to communicate back and forth with the
workers.  The worker processes serve the execution of tasks in the main (and
only) thread until they are signaled for completion.
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
The worker processes must import the main script in order to \fIunpickle\fP any
callable defined in the \fI\%__main__\fP module and submitted from the master
process. Furthermore, the callables may need access to other global
variables. At the worker processes, \fI\%mpi4py.futures\fP executes the main
script code (using the \fI\%runpy\fP module) under the \fB__worker__\fP
namespace to define the \fI\%__main__\fP module. The \fI\%__main__\fP and
\fB__worker__\fP modules are added to \fI\%sys.modules\fP (both at the
master and worker processes) to ensure proper \fIpickling\fP and \fIunpickling\fP\&.

During the initial import phase at the workers, the main script cannot
create and use new \fI\%MPIPoolExecutor\fP instances. Otherwise, each
worker would attempt to spawn a new pool of workers, leading to infinite
recursion. \fI\%mpi4py.futures\fP detects such recursive attempts to spawn
new workers and aborts the MPI execution environment. As the main script
code is run under the \fB__worker__\fP namespace, the easiest way to avoid
spawn recursion is using the idiom \fBif __name__ == \(aq__main__\(aq: ...\fP in
the main script.

.B class mpi4py.futures.MPIPoolExecutor(max_workers=None, initializer=None, initargs=(), **kwargs)
An \fI\%Executor\fP subclass that executes calls
asynchronously using a pool of at most \fImax_workers\fP processes.  If
\fImax_workers\fP is \fBNone\fP or not given, its value is determined from the
\fBMPI4PY_FUTURES_MAX_WORKERS\fP environment variable if set, or the MPI
universe size if set, otherwise a single worker process is spawned.  If
\fImax_workers\fP is lower than or equal to \fB0\fP, then a \fI\%ValueError\fP will
be raised.
.sp
\fIinitializer\fP is an optional callable that is called at the start of each
worker process before executing any tasks; \fIinitargs\fP is a tuple of
arguments passed to the initializer. If \fIinitializer\fP raises an exception,
all pending tasks and any attempt to submit new tasks to the pool will raise
a \fI\%BrokenExecutor\fP exception.

\fImpi_info\fP: \fI\%dict\fP or iterable yielding \fB(key, value)\fP pairs.
These \fB(key, value)\fP pairs are passed (through an \fBMPI.Info\fP object) to

.B map(func, *iterables, timeout=None, chunksize=1, **kwargs)
Equivalent to \fI\%map(func, *iterables)\fP except \fIfunc\fP is
executed asynchronously and several calls to \fIfunc\fP may be made
concurrently, out\-of\-order, in separate processes.  The returned iterator
raises a \fI\%TimeoutError\fP if
\fI\%__next__()\fP is called and the result isn’t available after
\fItimeout\fP seconds from the original call to \fI\%map()\fP\&.
\fItimeout\fP can be an int or a float.  If \fItimeout\fP is not specified or
\fBNone\fP, there is no limit to the wait time.  If a call raises an
exception, then that exception will be raised when its value is retrieved
from the iterator. This method chops \fIiterables\fP into a number of chunks
which it submits to the pool as separate tasks. The (approximate) size of
these chunks can be specified by setting \fIchunksize\fP to a positive
integer. For very long iterables, using a large value for \fIchunksize\fP can
significantly improve performance compared to the default size of one. By
default, the returned iterator yields results in\-order, waiting for
successive tasks to complete . This behavior can be changed by passing
the keyword argument \fIunordered\fP as \fBTrue\fP, then the result iterator
will yield a result as soon as any of the tasks complete.

after \fI\%shutdown()\fP will raise \fI\%RuntimeError\fP\&.
.sp
If \fIwait\fP is \fBTrue\fP then this method will not return until all the
pending futures are done executing and the resources associated with the
executor have been freed.  If \fIwait\fP is \fBFalse\fP then this method will
return immediately and the resources associated with the executor will be
freed when all pending futures are done executing.  Regardless of the
value of \fIwait\fP, the entire Python program will not exit until all
pending futures are done executing.
.sp
If \fIcancel_futures\fP is \fBTrue\fP, this method will cancel all pending
futures that the executor has not started running. Any futures that
are completed or running won’t be cancelled, regardless of the value
of \fIcancel_futures\fP\&.
.sp
You can avoid having to call this method explicitly if you use the
\fI\%with\fP statement, which will shutdown the executor instance

As the master process uses a separate thread to perform MPI communication
with the workers, the backend MPI implementation should provide support for
\fBMPI.THREAD_MULTIPLE\fP\&. However, some popular MPI implementations do not
support yet concurrent MPI calls from multiple threads. Additionally, users
may decide to initialize MPI with a lower level of thread support. If the
level of thread support in the backend MPI is less than
\fBMPI.THREAD_MULTIPLE\fP, \fI\%mpi4py.futures\fP will use a global lock to
serialize MPI calls. If the level of thread support is less than
\fBMPI.THREAD_SERIALIZED\fP, \fI\%mpi4py.futures\fP will emit a

If the level of thread support in the backend MPI is less than
\fBMPI.THREAD_SERIALIZED\fP (i.e, it is either \fBMPI.THREAD_SINGLE\fP or
\fBMPI.THREAD_FUNNELED\fP), in theory \fI\%mpi4py.futures\fP cannot be
used. Rather than raising an exception, \fI\%mpi4py.futures\fP emits a
warning and takes a “cross\-fingers” attitude to continue execution in the
hope that serializing MPI calls with a global lock will actually work.

Legacy MPI\-1 implementations (as well as some vendor MPI\-2 implementations) do
not support the dynamic process management features introduced in the MPI\-2
standard. Additionally, job schedulers and batch systems in supercomputing
facilities may pose additional complications to applications using the
\fBMPI_Comm_spawn()\fP routine.
.sp
With these issues in mind, \fI\%mpi4py.futures\fP supports an additonal, more
traditional, SPMD\-like usage pattern requiring MPI\-1 calls only. Python
applications are started the usual way, e.g., using the \fBmpiexec\fP
command. Python code should make a collective call to the
\fI\%MPICommExecutor\fP context manager to partition the set of MPI processes
within a MPI communicator in one master processes and many workers
processes. The master process gets access to an \fI\%MPIPoolExecutor\fP
instance to submit tasks. Meanwhile, the worker process follow a different
execution path and team\-up to execute the tasks submitted from the master.
.sp
Besides alleviating the lack of dynamic process managment features in legacy
MPI\-1 or partial MPI\-2 implementations, the \fI\%MPICommExecutor\fP context
manager may be useful in classic MPI\-based Python applications willing to take
advantage of the simple, task\-based, master/worker approach available in the
\fI\%mpi4py.futures\fP package.

in \fIcomm\fP) and the remaining worker processes. These sets are then connected
through an intercommunicator.  The target of the \fI\%with\fP statement

If \fI\%MPICommExecutor\fP is passed a communicator of size one (e.g.,
\fBMPI.COMM_SELF\fP), then the executor instace assigned to the target of the
\fI\%with\fP statement will execute all submitted tasks in a single
worker thread, thus ensuring that task execution still progress
asynchronously. However, the \fI\%GIL\fP will prevent the main and worker
threads from running concurrently in multicore processors. Moreover, the
thread context switching may harm noticeably the performance of CPU\-bound
tasks. In case of I/O\-bound tasks, the \fI\%GIL\fP is not usually an issue,
however, as a single worker thread is used, it progress one task at a
time. We advice against using \fI\%MPICommExecutor\fP with communicators of
size one and suggest refactoring your code to use instead a
\fI\%ThreadPoolExecutor\fP\&.

Recalling the issues related to the lack of support for dynamic process
managment features in MPI implementations, \fI\%mpi4py.futures\fP supports an
alternative usage pattern where Python code (either from scripts, modules, or
zip files) is run under command line control of the \fI\%mpi4py.futures\fP
package by passing \fB\-m mpi4py.futures\fP to the \fBpython\fP
executable.  The \fBmpi4py.futures\fP invocation should be passed a \fIpyfile\fP path
to a script (or a zipfile/directory containing a \fB__main__.py\fP file).
Additionally, \fBmpi4py.futures\fP accepts \fB\-m \fP\fImod\fP to execute a module
named \fImod\fP, \fB\-c \fP\fIcmd\fP to execute a command string \fIcmd\fP, or even
\fB\-\fP to read commands from standard input (\fI\%sys.stdin\fP).

Before starting the main script execution, \fI\%mpi4py.futures\fP splits
\fBMPI.COMM_WORLD\fP in one master (the process with rank 0 in \fBMPI.COMM_WORLD\fP)
and 16 workers and connect them through an MPI intercommunicator. Afterwards,
the master process proceeds with the execution of the user script code, which
eventually creates \fI\%MPIPoolExecutor\fP instances to submit
tasks. Meanwhile, the worker processes follow a different execution path to
serve the master.  Upon successful termination of the main script at the
master, the entire MPI execution environment exists gracefully. In case of any
unhandled exception in the main script, the master process calls
\fBMPI.COMM_WORLD.Abort(1)\fP to prevent deadlocks and force termination of
entire MPI execution environment.

.INDENT 3.5
Running scripts under command line control of \fI\%mpi4py.futures\fP is quite
similar to executing a single\-process application that spawn additional
workers as required. However, there is a very important difference users
should be aware of. All \fI\%MPIPoolExecutor\fP instances created at the
master will share the pool of workers. Tasks submitted at the master from
many different executors will be scheduled for execution in random order as
soon as a worker is idle. Any executor can easily starve all the workers
(e.g., by calling \fI\%MPIPoolExecutor.map()\fP with long iterables). If that
ever happens, submissions from other executors will not be serviced until
free workers are available.

The recommended way to execute the script is by using the \fBmpiexec\fP
command specifying one MPI process (master) and (optional but recommended) the
desired MPI universe size, which determines the number of additional
dynamically spawned processes (workers). The MPI universe size is provided
either by a batch system or set by the user via command\-line arguments to
\fBmpiexec\fP or environment variables. Below we provide examples for
MPICH and Open MPI implementations [1]\&. In all of these examples, the
\fBmpiexec\fP command launches a single master process running the Python
interpreter and executing the main script. When required, \fI\%mpi4py.futures\fP
spawns the pool of 16 worker processes. The master submits tasks to the workers
and waits for the results. The workers receive incoming tasks, execute them,
and send back the results to the master.
.sp
When using MPICH implementation or its derivatives based on the Hydra process
manager, the user can set the MPI universe size via \fB\-usize\fP argument to
\fBmpiexec\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ mpiexec \-n 1 \-usize 17 python julia.py
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or, alternatively, by setting the \fBMPIEXEC_UNIVERSE_SIZE\fP environment
variable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ MPIEXEC_UNIVERSE_SIZE=17 mpiexec \-n 1 python julia.py
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
In the Open MPI implementation, the MPI universe size can be set via \fB\-host\fP
argument to \fBmpiexec\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ mpiexec \-n 1 \-host <hostname>:17 python julia.py
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Another way to specify the number of workers is to use the
\fI\%mpi4py.futures\fP\-specific environment variable
\fBMPI4PY_FUTURES_MAX_WORKERS\fP:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ MPI4PY_FUTURES_MAX_WORKERS=16 mpiexec \-n 1 python julia.py
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note that in this case, the MPI universe size is ignored.
.sp
Alternatively, users may decide to execute the script in a more traditional
way, that is, all the MPI processes are started at once. The user script is run
under command\-line control of \fI\%mpi4py.futures\fP passing the \fI\%\-m\fP flag to the \fBpython\fP executable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ mpiexec \-n 17 python \-m mpi4py.futures julia.py
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
As explained previously, the 17 processes are partitioned in one master and 16
workers. The master process executes the main script while the workers execute
the tasks submitted by the master.
.IP [1] 5
When using an MPI implementation other than MPICH or Open MPI, please
check the documentation of the implementation and/or batch
system for the ways to specify the desired MPI universe size.

\fI\%pickle\fP protocol 5 (see \fI\%PEP 574\fP) introduced support for out\-of\-band
buffers, allowing for more efficient handling of certain object types with
large memory footprints.
.sp
MPI for Python uses the traditional in\-band handling of buffers. This approach
is appropriate for communicating non\-buffer Python objects, or buffer\-like
objects with small memory footprints. For point\-to\-point communication, in\-band
buffer handling allows for the communication of a pickled stream with a single
MPI message, at the expense of additional CPU and memory overhead in the
pickling and unpickling steps.
.sp
The \fI\%mpi4py.util.pkl5\fP module provides communicator wrapper classes
reimplementing pickle\-based point\-to\-point communication methods using pickle
protocol 5. Handling out\-of\-band buffers necessarily involve multiple MPI
messages, thus increasing latency and hurting performance in case of small size
data. However, in case of large size data, the zero\-copy savings of out\-of\-band
buffer handling more than offset the extra latency costs.  Additionally, these
wrapper methods overcome the infamous 2 GiB message count limit (MPI\-1 to
MPI\-3).

At import time, \fBmpi4py\fP initializes the MPI execution environment calling
\fBMPI_Init_thread()\fP and installs an exit hook to automatically call
\fBMPI_Finalize()\fP just before the Python process terminates. Additionally,
\fBmpi4py\fP overrides the default \fBERRORS_ARE_FATAL\fP error handler in favor
of \fBERRORS_RETURN\fP, which allows translating MPI errors in Python
exceptions. These departures from standard MPI behavior may be controversial,
but are quite convenient within the highly dynamic Python programming
environment. Third\-party code using \fBmpi4py\fP can just \fBfrom mpi4py import
MPI\fP and perform MPI calls without the tedious initialization/finalization
handling.  MPI errors, once translated automatically to Python exceptions, can
be dealt with the common \fI\%try\fP…\fI\%except\fP…\fI\%finally\fP clauses; unhandled MPI exceptions will print a traceback
which helps in locating problems in source code.
.sp
Unfortunately, the interplay of automatic MPI finalization and unhandled
exceptions may lead to deadlocks. In unattended runs, these deadlocks will
drain the battery of your laptop, or burn precious allocation hours in your
supercomputing facility.

Process 0 raises \fI\%ZeroDivisionError\fP exception before performing a send call to
process 1. As the exception is not handled, the Python interpreter running in
process 0 will proceed to exit with non\-zero status. However, as \fBmpi4py\fP
installed a finalizer hook to call \fBMPI_Finalize()\fP before exit, process
0 will block waiting for other processes to also enter the
\fBMPI_Finalize()\fP call. Meanwhile, process 1 will block waiting for a
message to arrive from process 0, thus never reaching to
\fBMPI_Finalize()\fP\&. The whole MPI execution environment is irremediably in
a deadlock state.
.sp
To alleviate this issue, \fBmpi4py\fP offers a simple, alternative command
line execution mechanism based on using the \fI\%\-m\fP
flag and implemented with the \fI\%runpy\fP module. To use this features, Python
code should be run passing \fB\-m mpi4py\fP in the command line invoking the
Python interpreter. In case of unhandled exceptions, the finalizer hook will
call \fBMPI_Abort()\fP on the \fBMPI_COMM_WORLD\fP communicator, thus
effectively aborting the MPI execution environment.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
When a process is forced to abort, resources (e.g. open files) are not
cleaned\-up and any registered finalizers (either with the \fI\%atexit\fP
module, the Python C/API function \fI\%Py_AtExit()\fP, or even the C
standard library function \fBatexit()\fP) will not be executed. Thus,
aborting execution is an extremely impolite way of ensuring process
termination. However, MPI provides no other mechanism to recover from a
deadlock state.

\fIMPI for Python\fP uses a standard distutils\-based build system. However,
some distutils commands (like \fIbuild\fP) have additional options:

\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
These days it is no longer required to use the MPI\-enabled Python
interpreter in most cases, and, therefore, it is not built by
default anymore because it is too difficult to reliably build a
Python interpreter across different distributions.  If you know
that you still \fBreally\fP need it, see below on how to use the
\fBbuild_exe\fP and \fBinstall_exe\fP commands.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Some MPI\-1 implementations (notably, MPICH 1) \fBdo require\fP the
actual command line arguments to be passed at the time
\fBMPI_Init()\fP is called. In this case, you will need to use a
re\-built, MPI\-enabled, Python interpreter binary executable. A basic
implementation (targeting Python 2.X) of what is required is shown
below:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
#include <Python.h>
#include <mpi.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
   int status, flag;
   MPI_Init(&argc, &argv);
   status = Py_Main(argc, argv);
   MPI_Finalized(&flag);
   if (!flag) MPI_Finalize();
   return status;
}
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The source code above is straightforward; compiling it should also
be. However, the linking step is more tricky: special flags have to be
passed to the linker depending on your platform. In order to alleviate
you for such low\-level details, \fIMPI for Python\fP provides some
pure\-distutils based support to build and install an MPI\-enabled
Python interpreter executable:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ cd mpi4py\-X.X.X
$ python setup.py build_exe [\-\-mpi=<name>|\-\-mpicc=/path/to/mpicc]
$ [sudo] python setup.py install_exe [\-\-install\-dir=$HOME/bin]
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
After the above steps you should have the MPI\-enabled interpreter
installed as \fIprefix\fP\fB/bin/python\fP\fIX\fP\fB\&.\fP\fIX\fP\fB\-mpi\fP (or
\fB$HOME/bin/python\fP\fIX\fP\fB\&.\fP\fIX\fP\fB\-mpi\fP). Assuming that
\fIprefix\fP\fB/bin\fP (or \fB$HOME/bin\fP) is listed on your

Perhaps you will need to set the \fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fP
environment variable (using \fBexport\fP, \fBsetenv\fP or
what applies to your system) pointing to the directory containing the
MPI libraries . In case of getting runtime linking errors when running
MPI programs, the following lines can be added to the user login shell
script (\fB\&.profile\fP, \fB\&.bashrc\fP, etc.).

MPICH 1 support for dynamic libraries is not completely
transparent. Users should set the environment variable
\fBMPICH_USE_SHLIB\fP to \fByes\fP in order to avoid link
problems when using the \fBmpicc\fP compiler wrapper.
